### Project Description
[# Negatve_AI
A "negative AI" refers to artificial intelligence systems that criticize people. This is an AI which is designed to improve human life and society by spitting thruth to their face.
Most Highly depressing ai model.
No-one wants to hear the truth so hence it is useless.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The problem that exist for a negative AI is trying to be helpful or fair.

Since a negative AI is designed to cause harm, spread misinformation, or be unfair, it never faces the challenge of trying to be good or make things better. It's built for the opposite]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[The "Unsolicited Compliment Generator" (our negative AI in this case) offers a solution to a problem nobody really had:

It solves the "problem" of not having a perfectly generic, slightly awkward compliment delivered to you on demand, without you having to do anything particularly praiseworthy.

Essentially, it's the solution for when you crave a bit of simulated positive reinforcement, but you're too busy (or unmotivated) to earn a real one. It provides a simple, low-effort way to feel acknowledged, even if the acknowledgment is completely automated and meaningless!]
